        <p style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;">Diary for students</p>
        <p>Games and sports are an integral part of a studentâ€™s life. A student should study hard to be successful in competitive examinations. But, he should also play games and sports to enjoy the health and vigor of life. Along with bookish learning, a student should spend his time on games and sports. There are many people who give importance only to bookish knowledge. Indeed, there is often no provision for games at all.</p>
        <p>There are many benefits of games and sports in education. Outdoor games such as football, cricket, badminton, tennis, etc. have many benefits. The participation in any one of them is not a fruitless or frivolous pursuit. They may not ensure any immediate gain. They may tell upon the health for the time being and may also affect education temporarily. But the outdoor games gradually build up a healthy body and make the mind energetic.</p>
        <p>Reading and writing involve mental strain. The mind then hungers for relief. Reading and writing also involve physical strain. The physique then needs extra fuel. Regular participation in outdoor games in such cases makes the body fit and at the same time gives the relief required.</p>
